## About me

- Ze-Hao Huang is a PhD candidate of Physics at Nanjing University.
- He was born and grew up in Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province, China.
- He received B.Sc. degree in Physics and Computer Science & Technology from Nanchang University in 2019.
- He was graduated from the Class of the Gifted Young (5-Year coherent middle/high school) at Nanchang No.10 Middle School.
- His research focuses on the study of quantum simulation of (1) topological quantum matters, especially for them in non-Hermitian systems, (2) quantum many-body systems, and (3) quantum foundations.


## Research Interests

Broadly speaking, he is interested in the research of the intersection of `physics` and `quantum information (computing)`, `machine learning`, and `modern mathematics`, such as
- Condensed Matter Physics + Quantum Information -> Quantum Simulation
    > Status: Main Direction during my PhD. Some articles have been published.
- Condensed Matter Physics + Machine Learning -> Quantum Machine Learning
    > Status: Accumulating background knowledge ......
- Quantum Information + Topology (Geometry) -> Quantum Information Geometry, Geometry of Quantum Computation (Complexity)
    > Status: Looking for a specific question ......

<!-- Currently, he tries to design some experimental schemes based on weak-value measurement techniques for verifying novel quantum phenomena. -->
