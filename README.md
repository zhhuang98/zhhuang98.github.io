## About me

Ze-Hao Huang (黄泽豪) is a PhD candidate of Physics at Nanjing University.
He received B.Sc. degree in Physics and Computer Science & Technology from Nanchang University in 2019.
His research focuses on the study of quantum simulation of (1) topological quantum matters, especially for them in non-Hermitian systems, (2) quantum many-body systems, and (3) quantum foundations.


## Research Interests

He is interested in the research of the intersection of physics and quantum information (computing), machine learning, and modern mathematics, such as
- Condensed Matter Physics + Quantum Information -> Quantum Simulation
  > Status: Main Direction in my PhD. Some articles have been published.
- Condensed Matter Physics + Machine Learning -> Quantum Machine Learning
  > Status: Accumulating background knowledge ......
- Quantum Information + Topology (Geometry) -> ?
  > Status: Looking for a specific question ......
