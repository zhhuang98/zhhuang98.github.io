## About me

Ze-Hao Huang (黄泽豪) is a PhD candidate of Physics at Nanjing University.
He received B.Sc. degree from Nanchang University in 2019.
His research focuses on the study of quantum simulation of topological quantum matters, especially for them in non-Hermitian systems.

## Research Interests

I am interested in the research of the intersection of physics and quantum computing, machine learning, and modern mathematics, such as
- Condensed Matter Physics + Quantum Information -> Quantum Simulation
- Condensed Matter Physics + Machine Learning -> Quantum Machine Learning
- Quantum Information + Topology (Geometry) -> ?
